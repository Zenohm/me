  <p>Everyone has ideas. Some people show others, and others keep them private.</p>
  <p>It's time for me to start putting myself and my ideas out there for others to see, appreciate, and think about.</p>
  <p>For some people, this might be a bad idea. For me, it might be as well, but I learn best by doing, so let's do.</p>
  <p>Here I organize my thoughts and show off my work, which if at least one person appreciates, will make this all worth it.</p>
